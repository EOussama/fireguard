## Description

Fireguard is a SvelteKit-based web application designed to facilitate authentication for Chrome extensions and web apps in light of the changes introduced by Manifest V3. It utilizes Firebase Authentication to handle user sign-ins and securely communicates authentication tokens back to the parent application.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication**: Leverages Firebase for robust, secure user authentication.
- **Compatibility with Manifest V3**: Designed to work with Chrome extensions adhering to Manifest V3 guidelines.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be easily integrated with extensions and web apps.
- **Token Communication**: Securely sends authentication tokens to the parent application using message events.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eoussama/fireguard.git
    cd fireguard
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment variables**: Creates a `.env` file from `.env.example` and populate it with the required values.

4. **Run the development server**: 
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Usage

1. **Open Fireguard in a new window**:
    * This can be triggered from your Chrome extension or web app.

2. **Complete authentication**:
    * The user will authenticate using the Fireguard authentication.

3. **Receive the token**:
    * Fireguard will send the authentication token back to the parent application using a message event.

4. **Integration with Firemitt**:
    * Fireguard is designed to work seamlessly with [Firemitt](https://github.com/eoussama/firemitt), an npm package that simplifies communication between your host application and Fireguard.
    * Refer to the [Firemitt documentation](https://eoussama.github.io/firemitt) for detailed integration steps.
